# Legally binding blockchain ID

### Link a blockchain private key to a CA key issued by the root key of Brasil government’s PKI tree. Using ENS and [EIP 1078](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1078) for universal login with, [EIP 1077](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1077) gas relayer, [ERC 725](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-725) proxy identity, and [ERC 735](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/735) claim holder to create a fail-safe key management solution and empower noobs with a terrific user experience.

* Create a dynamic digital identity that’s issued by a certificate authority and link it to a Ethereum/RSK private key so it can be used to provide a simple and secure way to interact with the financial system, judicial system, unions, issue invoices, access public services, interact with the government service’s online systems, pay taxes, claim rights and sign contracts that are legally binding and equivalent to handwritten signatures.

* With this implementation the user doesn’t even have to know what blockchain, ethereum, or gas means. They will simply purchase a electronic identity from a certificate authority, do the standard process document validation KYC procedure and biometric  verification. Download and app, where they can do the traditional signing method recognised by ICANN 

* With a dynamic identity documents can be revoked and replaced, reducing troubles for the user. They are quiet common in Brasil. Digital certificates are issued representing a digital identity to verify a citizen, company or institution. The governments holds the root key  through [ICP (PKI) - Brasil](http://www.iti.gov.br/icp-brasil), does the issuance of the certificates and partners with the private sector to enable the access to the system.

* ICP (PKI) - Brasil was appointed several times as a reference model on 8/11/17 on a public hearing in the US senate, Paulino de Rego Barros, and Richard smith, respectively previous and current interim CEO of Equifax were present along with Marisa Mayer. Where they discussed consumer protection in the information age in the face of several hacks and data breach, such as Equifax’s which affected 145 million people and Yahoo’s 3 billion users.
